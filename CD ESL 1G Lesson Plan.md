# OBJECTIVE

Please create an Engage, Study, and Activate structured ESL lesson plan using the SOURCE MATERIALS attached or below.

- Engage
  - Comes first to spark interest, activate prior knowledge, and create context in a topic.
- Study
  - Focuses on the construction of the topic.
  - Examine the language: looking at how it works, either grammar rules, vocabulary items, or pronunciation.
  - Practice in a controlled way: drills, gap-fills, matching exercises, substitution, or guided practice that checks accuracy.
  - Notice patterns: students become aware of form, meaning, and use (often through teacher guidance, elicitation, or discovery).
- Activate
  - Comes last for learners to use the language freely and communicatively, focusing on fluency rather than accuracy.
  - Produce language: students put grammar, vocabulary, and skills into practice in meaningful ways.
  - Communicate ideas: activities are designed so success is measured by getting a message across, not by perfect accuracy.
  - Experiment and personalize: learners draw on everything they know, mixing old and new language to express themselves.
  - Typical activities:
    - Role-plays and simulations
    - Debates or discussions
    - Creative writing (stories, dialogues, blog posts)
    - Problem-solving or information-gap tasks
    - Presentations or projects

Avoid:
- Unnecessary instructions, introductions, conclusions, or qualifiers without added value
- Wordiness or excessive passive voice; aim for clear, direct language
- Assumptions about unstated opinions or preferences
- Complex vocabulary or jargon, unless precisely relevant
- Putting syllable stress before the explanation
