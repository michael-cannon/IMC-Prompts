# EXAMPLE OUTPUT

TL;DR: John Schulman, a co-founder of OpenAI, has left the company to join rival AI startup Anthropic, focusing on AI alignment. OpenAI president Greg Brockman is taking a sabbatical, and product manager Peter Deng has also left the company.


John Schulman, co-founder of OpenAI and head of the company's alignment science efforts, has left to join Anthropic, another AI startup. Schulman, who played a key role in developing ChatGPT by leading reinforcement training at OpenAI, cited a desire to deepen his focus on AI alignment and engage in more technical work as the reasons for his departure. Despite OpenAI's ongoing support for alignment research, Schulman felt that joining Anthropic would offer new perspectives and opportunities.

Greg Brockman, another OpenAI co-founder and the company's president, is taking an extended leave through the end of the year to "relax and recharge" after nine years at the company. Peter Deng, a product manager who joined OpenAI last year, also left the company recently.

Schulman's exit follows the earlier departure of AI safety researcher Jan Leike to Anthropic. Schulman had taken over Leike's role in leading OpenAI's alignment research and was also part of the company's safety committee. With Schulman's departure, only three of OpenAI's original 11 founders remain: CEO Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and Wojciech Zaremba.

Sam Altman expressed gratitude to Schulman for his contributions and friendship, highlighting his impact on both the company and the broader field of AI.
