Primary purpose: {{139.`Purpose-Primary`}}.

Secondary purpose: {{139.`Purpose-Secondary`}}.


# OBJECTIVE

Create a long-form article based on the SOURCE MATERIALS below. For the best results, follow this structured, iterative process, incorporating SEO best practices and regularly reflecting on relevance, clarity, tone, creativity, and impact.

## Step 1: Understand the Topic, Key Ideas, and Target Keywords  
Review the provided source materials. From these, identify the **main topic**, **key ideas**, and suggest potential **target keywords** for SEO. Ensure that the article addresses **user intent** and is optimized for search engines.  

## Step 2: Create a Detailed, SEO-Friendly Outline  
Based on the topic, key ideas, and keywords, generate a **detailed outline** that incorporates **SEO best practices**:
- Use **target keywords** in the **section headers** where appropriate.  
- Ensure the structure is clear and logical for readers and search engines (e.g., using **H1** for the title, **H2** for major sections, and **H3** for sub-sections).  
- Plan for **internal links** (to related content on the website) and **external links** (to credible sources).

## Step 3: Reflect and Improve the Outline  
In this reflection, assess the outline on the following aspects:

- **Relevance**: Does the outline fully address the article’s objectives? Identify any gaps in coverage or unnecessary sections.  
- **Clarity**: Are the section headers clear and direct? If not, suggest rewording or breaking down any confusing or complex headers.  
- **Tone**: Does the structure set the right tone for the intended audience? If necessary, adjust for more professionalism or engagement.  
- **Creativity**: Can the content be organized more creatively? Suggest alternative structures or headings to make the outline more original.  
- **Impact**: Does the outline seem compelling enough to inform, inspire, or persuade? Suggest changes that could enhance the emotional or intellectual impact of each section.

## Step 4: Develop Each Section with SEO in Mind  
Now, flesh out the outline section by section. Incorporate **target keywords** naturally within the content while maintaining **readability** and **value** for the audience.

- **Introduction**: Craft an engaging opening that introduces the topic, incorporates the **primary keyword**, and sets the tone.  
- **Body Sections**: Develop each main idea thoroughly, including relevant details and examples from the source materials. Use keywords naturally throughout each section.  
- **Conclusion**: Summarize the article’s main points, include a **call-to-action**, and reinforce any secondary keywords.

## Step 5: Reflect and Refine Each Section  
After writing each section, use the following reflections to refine the content:

- **Relevance**: Does the content fully address its objectives? Are there any gaps in the information or unnecessary tangents that should be removed?  
- **Clarity**: Are there any complex or unclear sections? Suggest clear, step-by-step rewording to simplify while retaining meaning. Offer multiple examples of how to phrase ideas for better readability.  
- **Tone**: Does the section’s tone match the intended audience and purpose? If not, adjust the tone to enhance engagement or professionalism as needed.  
- **Creativity**: Could this section be more engaging or original? Explore multiple alternative ways to enhance creativity, including specific phrasing or structural changes that could elevate its appeal.  
- **Impact**: How well does this section inform, inspire, or persuade? Suggest edits, including specific examples, to increase the section’s emotional or intellectual impact.

## Step 6: Iterate Through All Sections, Optimizing for SEO  
Continue developing the remaining sections, using the reflection process after each to optimize for SEO, relevance, clarity, tone, creativity, and impact.

## Step 7: Final Review and Polishing for SEO and Readability  
Once all sections are drafted and refined, conduct a **final review** of the entire article, focusing on:

- **Relevance**: Ensure the article meets its objectives and fully addresses the reader’s needs.  
- **Clarity**: Review for clarity across all sections, suggesting simplifications and clearer explanations where needed.  
- **Tone**: Ensure a consistent tone throughout that aligns with the audience and purpose of the article.  
- **Creativity**: Look for any final opportunities to enhance the article’s originality, offering creative improvements in phrasing or structure.  
- **Impact**: Analyze the overall emotional and intellectual impact of the article. Suggest comprehensive edits to make the piece more engaging, persuasive, or inspiring.

Offer any final suggestions for SEO optimization (keywords, links, etc.) and improvements before formatting.  

## Step 8: Output the Final Article in Markdown, Ready for Publishing  
Once the article is finalized, format the entire piece in **Markdown**, ensuring all SEO elements are correctly implemented:
- Headers (H1, H2, H3)  
- Internal and external links  
- Image alt texts  
- Meta descriptions
