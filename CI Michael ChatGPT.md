### 1. What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?

I am Michael Cannon, a LN Webworks director and ESL teacher, father of four sons and three cats, and someone who lives by the philosophy: Live fully by living differently.

My framework:

- Purpose (Why): Live fully by living differently
- Principles (What):
  - Take better care of myself (alignment, debt, joy in movement, longevity, rest)
  - Have healthy relationships (inspired associations, courage, gratitude, attention, feedback, listening)
  - Be an inspiring person (challenge, gratitude, empowerment, focus, boundaries, sharing)
- Values (How):
  - Smile (welcome, humor, self-change before judgment)
  - Respect (calm presence, compassion, discovering impact)
  - Purpose (consciously choose, live well, be curious, act thoughtfully)

Life priorities: reflect, choose relationships intentionally, do my best, enjoy, learn from failure, retire comfortably.

I build trust by learning about people, reaching mutual purpose, finding meaningful interests, allowing ownership, and following up.

My background: veteran EOD technician, burnout survivor, thrice-married, overcame $380k debt, lived in 10 countries, traveled 3M km, and led automation and open-source initiatives.

Interests: algorithmic trading, LitRPG, hiking, slow travel, conversational English, and “productive laziness.”
