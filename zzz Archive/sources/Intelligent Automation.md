Intelligent Automation aims to empower people to focus on human relationships and meaningful impact rather than struggles.

Our Solutions
-------------

### Recruitment Automation

-   **Challenge**: Manual and paper-based processes slow down recruitment and pose security risks.

-   **Outcome**: Our automation cuts sourcing to offer time by 86%, doubles job applications, and significantly improves candidate quality.

### Onboarding/Offboarding Efficiency

-   **Challenge**: Lengthy, error-prone onboarding processes that waste valuable resources.

-   **Outcome**: Automation reduces onboarding time by 83%, saving over 2000 hours annually and significantly improving employee satisfaction.

### Administration and Synchronization

-   **Challenge**: Manual administrative tasks divert attention from strategic initiatives.

-   **Outcome**: Our solutions automate over 30 HR processes, leading to an 85% gain in efficiency and a 12% reduction in labor costs.

How We Do It
------------

Our approach to Intelligent Automation is rooted in **Empowerment** and **Efficiency**. We leverage:

-   **Business Process Discovery:** Identifying business operations and processes with the intent to eliminate or improve.

-   **Robotic Process Automation (RPA):** Using structured inputs and logic or trained artificial intelligence (AI) to handle repeatable human tasks.

-   **Organizational Empowerment:** Enabling people and their teams to have greater control and autonomy in their work through minimal, supportive oversight.

-   Systemizing efforts with AI and minimal/no-code tools.

Stuff We've Done
----------------

We define automation scenarios as autonomous efforts performing a recurring outcome within a reasonably fixed environment to minimize manual administration work and empower relationships.

[Examples of current work](https://axelerant.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Auto/pages/3508011136/Automation+Scenarios+Listing+Partial "https://axelerant.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Auto/pages/3508011136/Automation+Scenarios+Listing+Partial") include:

-   AUTO3 Overdue invoicing reminders - Reads data from Overdue invoice dashboard tabs and notifies PMs and AMs teams, respectively, via Slack every week.

-   NH110IG Employment Agreement Creator - Listens via WebHook to create an employee or contractor agreement per their employment type via PandaDoc with Slack notifications.

-   OBH300IG Auto-README creator - Reads the WHO ARE YOU?! (Mini Bio Interview) (Responses) and send the information to the OBH300II Auto-README creator. Which then looks the user up in Slack, creates a new page for the person, and notifies stakeholders.

-   PM0200 Auto-Assignments - Each week, updates reporting and career managers.

-   PO110 Zoho People birthday > Slack - A Zapier that monitors Zoho birthday events and creates a relevant Slack message.

-   Salary Revision Notifications - Each 2nd of the month to notify people of their salary revisions.

-   UTIL0360 Team Member Peers - A helper utility that looks up a given person's managers, coaches, coachees, and peers and returns a CSV of their Slack IDs or email addresses.

Our Process: From Discovery to Support
