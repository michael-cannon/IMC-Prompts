TLDR I consciously choose who I am and what I do, even when doing so is unpopular.

Hello, I'm Michael Cannon, a boundless Virgo water-rat, Drusus & Jace's remote dad, for [@Axelerant's](https://www.axelerant.com/about) success and living by kind, conscious choices.

A decade ago, I was tired of working for tomorrow and not reaching my dreams. So, I stopped chasing them.

Instead, I decided to live by decomposing dreams into daily tangible bits as actions to become closer to my ideal self.

In other words, I live my future life the best I can now.

In the years since, I've thought much and reframed my purpose, principles, and values, plus their traits. Creating boundaries through them of an aspirational means versus specific actions has worked best for me.

For example, moving for the joy of it gets me out of my home for a walk easier than going to the gym thrice weekly as a goal.

More importantly, those life boundaries helped craft my daily life decision framework, which meant making tough choices that eventually made life easier.

Like letting toxic relationships go or recognizing I'm no longer capable of high-impact sports.

Creating holism.
----------------

I base my life purpose, principles, and values around the concepts of why, what, and how.

-   Purpose forms the why.

-   Principles compose the what.

-   Values define the how.

It took about two years of weekly deep reflections before my core principles, values, and traits solidified. Since then, I've been pondering and refining them quarterly.

To start living better by my purpose, I had to recognize myself honestly. Like, I have fat, my ego causes trouble, and while I'm very responsible, I'm not too fond of discipline.

While choices like fasting are part of the taking better care of myself principle, they are tricky.

For example, while I feel great fasting, I can only do it when I'm not relocating. And it took a while to figure out it was not a discipline issue; it was a curiosity because I used to be on the road six to nine months a year.

These days, I eat whatever seems appealing for the first two weeks of a new location. After that, I can fast two or three days a week because curiosity no longer drives my choices.

Balancing intent and actions of principles is an ongoing compromise. Some days will be a miss, like not moving around outside because I'm feeling lazy.

So while it might seem like I've sorted my life out, I've off days just like you.

Being me starts with a purpose.

Live fully by living differently (Why)
--------------------------------------

I'm not interested in living perfectly or following in others' footsteps. I'm interested in what I find curious, enjoyable, and inspiring.

Therefore, given that the moment appeals to my principles and values, it's a good time for me.

My first step and principle in achieving my purpose are that:

### I take better care of myself (What #1)

-   Meditate for alignment

-   Minimize debt

-   Move for the joy of it

-   Munch towards a long and content life

-   Sleep well each day

When I was a cross-country runner or a bomb squad technician, coaches and superiors kept me directed. Now, I must care for myself toward a long, fulfilling life.

I had more specific traits, like a 20-minute workout each day. Yet that felt rigid and, with my dislike for discipline, hard to maintain.

Moving for the joy of it is an easier aspiration to partake in when I'm tired or stressed because I can sync that time with a meditation session.

So, shifting something from a must-do to a desire-to-do has dramatically helped me regularly perform self-care.

The second way I fulfill my purpose is to:

### I have healthy relationships (What #2)

-   Associate with whom I care for or am inspired by

-   Courageous in thoughts, words, and deeds

-   Give timely, specific feedback and recognition

-   Give undistracted attention to conversations

It took me until my early-40s to realize that not every relationship deserves my time. Continuing some associations created significant toxicity in my life and affected others.

With a heavy heart, I began evaluating my relationships. I categorized them towards keep or not by helping, hindering, or doing nothing for me.

The most challenging relationship I left was with my wife and best friend of 20 years. Our first 13 years were incredible, yet the latter times found us unable to stay connected despite our best efforts.

Now my relationships are based on recurring, positive life choices. And when I'm with someone, I focus on them and ignore distractions around us.

The third path to my purpose is:

### I am an inspiring leader (What #3)

-   Challenge the status quo

-   Demonstrate gratitude for peers and their supporters

-   Engage and empower people to own what they do

-   Focus on priorities

-   Have reasonable boundaries and expectations for myself and others

-   Share my learnings

I want my work to have joy and meaning. And over time, I have learned that my best work comes alongside great leaders and managers.

I have learned to avoid the boss mode of telling people what to do because that action antagonizes most folks away from our desired outcomes.

Build respect and trust by making time to

-   Learn about one another

-   Reach a mutual purpose

-   Find a meaningful interest

-   Allow the person ownership in doing

-   Follow up

And through that trust and respect, they often remain beside me.

Values Define the Path
----------------------

Three core values define how I consistently act no matter what I'm doing to accomplish my life's purpose.

Beginning with:

### Smile (How #1)

Without speaking, a simple smile conveys welcome, encouragement, and humor. And smiling helps prevent me from judging others and the situations we find ourselves in. Instead, I decide to accept, change, or release myself from challenging moments.

Through smiling, I can begin to build a relationship, leading to my second value:

### Demonstrate Respect (How #2)

Curiosity and respect for our differences are keys to getting along to build trust that allows for challenging conversations. In which a situation can be peacefully discussed with good intent toward positive outcomes.

To help myself demonstrate respect, I follow several specific actions: calm presence, discover impact, and have compassion in moving forward.

Those respectful actions require direction, or else closure remains away. Therefore my third value helps create a mini-why:

### Have Purpose (How #3)

While stating have purpose seems recursive, it's a critical reminder of each moment I have. Which has helped me identify my number one value trait.

Consciously choose.

That trait is the foundation of how I act in every moment. And has the positive consequence of me owning everything I do by leading me toward what matters and ignoring the rest.

Next, having purpose has helped me realize that I prefer quality of life over a high standard of living; to live well.

Third, to have a purpose, I must know what is possible, which helps me be curious. To expand my horizons, create opportunities for positive change, and sometimes refresh my memory.

Lastly, I act thoughtfully through purpose and conscious choice to reach my intended outcome. And sometimes, that means doing nothing.

Being Me.
---------

My living fully requires recurring reflection. That reflection often leads to determining key actions of immediate priorities and, sometimes, crafting a new direction or perspective.

Authenticity matters in building hope, trust, and inspiration with those around me, which means sharing the good, the bad, and the ugly of ourselves. Leading us to craft stories that others relate to from our most embarrassing and frustrating times.

No matter what, I continue to do my best. And learn from and share the failures. So together, we will do better.

Deliberate Life Goals.
----------------------

-   Be with family.

-   Feel good about me.

-   Retire comfortably by 62.

-   Sustainable ownership--engage, empower, and inspire others to own what they do.

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me, and visit [ImMichaelCannon.com](http://immichaelcannon.com/) to find out where you can follow me.

Being Michael Background Interview
==================================

Could you describe a specific moment or experience that marked your choice to embark on this unique life path?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was 15 years into a relationship and couldn't understand why I was doing reasonably well at work, yet my home life was unhappy. With so much happening, I felt something was wrong with me, and I couldn't identify the source.

At work, we hired a life coach, and after saying no multiple times to talk about things, I finally said yes. Those first conversations got me thinking, and I realized that while life felt against me, it was just my perspective.

In opening my eyes to the fact that I had a genuine choice about my environment and how I responded to it, I began paying ever deeper attention to my interactions with the people and things around me.

This time was also when my then-wife and I finally figured out why our eldest child remained small and had constant stomach aches: celiac disease. An autoimmune disorder prevents the body from absorbing necessary nutrients due to constant inflammation from gluten sources, often found in wheat.

A single choice to eat the same way as Drusus had to, so they'd not be alone, started the fundamental shift in everything I would do further. It started my saying no to conventional wisdom and social norms.

For my yes' according to oft thought patterns made my son unhealthy and me unhappy.

How do you integrate living for today with an eye on the future?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Balancing living for today while keeping an eye on the future is about striking a harmonious chord between being fully present and strategically prepared. I embody this balance by living out principles and values that allow me to savor the moment and simultaneously pave the way for days to come.

I meditate daily to cultivate a long-term habit of mindfulness. It's a commitment that enjoys immediate and future calm and clarity.

It took over 20 years to get debt-free, and now I live by cash the best I can to enjoy the present without oppressive financial strain. It's less about cutting corners and more about making thoughtful choices that promise a secure, comfortable future.

As I get older, my intense physical activity has reduced, and I enjoy slower-paced hikes and walking hand-in-hand with my wife. I no longer strive to go hundreds of kilometers of cycling each week. Instead, I delight in the joy of the present while simultaneously nurturing my physical health for the long haul. Opting for joy in moving around ensures consistency, benefitting my current and future health.

The relationships I foster reflect this philosophy as well. I intentionally develop connections that enrich my life now and serve as a cornerstone for a fulfilling future. By associating with those who inspire me or whom I care deeply for, I enhance my everyday experience and build a robust support system that will stand the test of time.

Leadership extends beyond the now, as my actions today are crafted with the vision of tomorrow. I challenge the status quo and share my discoveries, aiming to forge a more dynamic workplace in the future. By empowering others to take ownership now, I am building a more engaged team today and mentoring tomorrow's leaders.

My three core values---smiling, demonstrating respect, and having a purpose---guide this philosophy. A simple smile can transform the immediate while establishing a pattern of positive interactions for the future. Demonstrating respect, such as giving someone my undivided attention, fortifies relationships and lays a foundation of trust that remains indispensable over time. Living purposefully in every decision ensures I constantly move toward a future that reflects my deepest values and aspirations.

In essence, the philosophy I live by involves creating day-to-day practices that are fulfilling in the moment and serve as stepping stones toward a future that aligns with my deeply held values and goals. Consciously living means prioritizing actions that fulfill the present 'me' while forging a path for the 'me' I aim to become.

Is there a brief story you'd like to include in the introduction that encapsulates your journey or philosophy?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's a potent narrative thread that weaves through the fabric of my life, a tale of awakening to the power of choice, especially the choice to say no. It's not just about rejecting what doesn't serve me but about embracing the freedom to pursue what truly matters. It's a story that has resonated with others and shown me the universal struggle to live authentically.

Saying no comes in many forms.

It could be by being the solitaire, dissenting voice to stand for my values and commitment to an alternative future during a business meeting.

Letting go of unhealthy familial relationships wasn't easy. It was a choice fraught with emotional turmoil, but it was a necessary step to honor my well-being. It affirmed my right to a life filled with harmony and mutual respect beyond kinship.

The impact of these choices became strikingly evident in the most unexpected places. On the train or in coffee shops, strangers would approach me, having overheard a conversation or seen a presentation. They would share their stories, mirroring the challenges of standing true to themselves. These interactions, brief as they might be, were affirmations that my journey was a shared human experience.

These moments have underscored a profound truth: people yearn to make the right decisions for themselves, to be truer to themselves. My story, woven from threads of courage, choice, and change, isn't just mine. It's an echo of countless unheard voices seeking to find their way.

Through my narrative, I want to illuminate the path for others, to show that saying no can be a powerful affirmation of self, and that living truthfully is not an act of defiance but a celebration of one's essence. This is the heartbeat of my philosophy, the pulse of my life's work, and the essence of the anecdote I wish to share with my readers.

In "Being Michael," I share this journey for others to see their potential reflected, inspire them to embrace their individuality, and encourage them to make choices that resonate with their core.

I invite you, the reader, to join me on this path of self-discovery and transformation, stepping into the life you were meant to live --- fully, consciously, and unapologetically.

You've mentioned an inspiring, personable, conversational, and insightful tone. Are there any phrases or words you often use that you'd like me to incorporate to maintain your authentic voice?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Engage, empower, and inspire people to own what they do.

-   It's just different.

-   It's neither good nor bad, right or wrong; it's just a different point of view.

-   Howdy!

-   Welcome aboard.

-   It's okay to feel way.

-   Please take a break; the work will still be here later on.

Can you describe when you realized you needed to change your life?
------------------------------------------------------------------

I found myself successful at work, yet not at home. I didn't get it.

Many folks told me during our conversations that they felt safe talking with me, even through complex topics.

In my mind, I couldn't relate. And I wouldn't until after being divorced and on a coffee date in Vietnam six years later.

My true life journey began 15 years into a 20-year relationship; I recognized something was wrong with me, though I didn't know what.

And that moment didn't happen until I finally said yes to talking with Mridula, Axelerant's first life coach. During those conversations, while I don't think I shared that I blamed others for my situation, I did get thinking about why so much seemed to be happening to me.

Through my life coach sessions, I began to reflect upon my whys and what to eventually know that I sacrificed who I was for my second wife. And I was unhappy because we couldn't support each other as we should have.

Even now, I don't blame my second wife, for we probably didn't know better back then. We come from the background that love conquers all, yet I've since learned there's more than love, and love can hurt.

Especially those that we love the most. There are so many wrong choices because of toxic love.

And so, recognizing that I was choosing to blame others despite being the central piece, I finally took responsibility for my choices. And began to figure out why I was living my life as I did.

What was your first unconventional choice that set you apart from the crowd, and how did it feel?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When 2-year-old Drusus was diagnosed with celiac disease, I decided to follow their diet requirements because I didn't want them to feel excluded in life.

I didn't know it would later be the moment I consider the start of my real life. That point in time was when I began moving away from being a narcissist and toward being kind and empathetic.

I used to think that food allergies and crying were weaknesses.

How did adopting a gluten-free diet with your son impact your perspective on making choices that align with personal values?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Choosing to eat by Drusus' dietary restrictions was eye-opening and a start on my health improvements.

First, I learned that a speck of wheat flour is enough to cause stomach inflammation. This means that celiac disease holders will not get their needed nutrients from the food they eat. Therefore, carefree trips to eat out suddenly became intense discussions about food preparation and kitchen cleanliness.

For every freaking meal out. What a significant pain in the arse for daily life.

Second, having those discussions with restaurant folks about staying wheat-free made me face people like me, holders of incorrect truths: food allergies don't exist.

Knowing now that lousy food choices literally would kill my kid, I began to care like never before. I had to overcome my perceptions and accept truths I didn't believe.

I had to change because I was the one person in the world to stand up for a 2-year-old. And since they didn't fully understand their situation, I had to learn.

Third, so much about food and production methods that I was ignorant about before came to light. While the food might not contain wheat, it's produced in a facility that uses it.

Because a speck of wheat is enough to cause stomach lining inflammation, facility cleanliness became a concern. This led to learning about the standards for certified gluten-free food and facilities across nations.

Fourth, due to all of those mentioned challenges, it was easier to buy natural or safe ingredients and prepare home-cooked meals more often. This meant I knew the food source and was aware of the food's intended effects on a meal and for a person.

Lastly, because meals weren't convenient anymore, they became the start of family conversations during preparation and sitting down to eat. No more rushing through the meal; we'd sit and converse about the day and intentions for the time ahead.

Out of those meal times came two essential changes. One, no electronics at the table. Two, I stopped thinking about what to say next and instead listened to understand what was being said or intended.

Because a two-year-old isn't the most articulate conversationalist.

Can you share an instance where rejecting the status quo led to a better outcome for you personally or professionally?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My most common status quo buster effectively demonstrates that I'm paying attention to other people when I'm with them because my words have specifics and weight applied to them.

Stepping back, I find rejecting the status quo a problematic balance.

On one hand, it's about being selfish for the things I prefer or desire. On the other hand, it's about playing nice with others, aiding them, or doing what they want.

Yet, the key I've found is the difference between being nice and kind. Nice lacks boundaries, and to me, therefore, no meaning.

For example, saying you look good today is a typical nice statement, polite yet open-ended. To say you're looking chic in that outfit is kind because there's a known reason.

In short, being nice is about unshared knowns, platitudes, and good intentions but nothing to create a result.

Being kind is of the shared knowns; therefore, it derives meaning and results.

Ultimately, each time I provide praise, there's a subject commented upon with an emotional appeal.

What daily mindfulness practices do you employ that help maintain a balance between living in the present and planning for the future?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over a decade back, when I first got going with meditation, I'd wake around 5 AM, put on sweats, and wander down to the beach for sunrise stretches and calming mind exercises.

At that time, I had trouble slowing down and finding peace in the moment. Therefore, my daily meditation was structured and intentional by what others suggested and felt applicable to me.

And each evening, upon getting into bed, I'd reflect upon the day, attempt to calm my mind, and think how my body felt. A process to help me fall asleep faster than within an hour or two.

Over the next few years, I'd keep with structured morning meditations of waking and sitting Lotus style. Followed in the evening by daily reflections.

Some mornings I'd work in a gratitude journal or do "omms."

When I finally started identifying my life's purpose, principles, and values, my daily meditations shifted away from the structures others suggested to something I found relevant.

The words of guru Rahul came to mind: You don't need to sit to meditate. And I also started giving more consideration to the importance of breathing.

Those considerations broke me of Lotus meditation, finding my first moments upon waking, remaining laid down, and reflecting on my life priorities: purpose, principles, and values. Sometimes in detail, often just top-level to center myself.

And later in the day, when heading to the bathroom or riding the elevator, I'd take two breaths and remind myself of my top-level priorities.

Upon lying down to bed, I'd reflect on the day with gratitude or think about what I liked and what might be done differently.

How has meditation contributed to your purposeful living, and can you provide an example of how it has affected a decision or outcome in your life?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I use small moments throughout the day to center myself; however, I might be placed: riding the scooter, laying in bed, standing at the urinal, walking to get a drink,...

I use those times to remind myself of my top-level priorities: purpose, principles, and values. When relevant, think deeply about their traits and how my moment fits.

Outside of bed, I begin these small moments by inhaling and exhaling to help relieve tension in my chest.

Other times, doing a 4-second square breath helps bring me present to the moment so I can give greater attention to it.

I'm repeating myself, yet repetition is a great technique to enable focus for me. I use breathing and reflection on my priorities to aid my decision-making.

Knowing my top priorities helps me ignore the extraneous information that comes my way. So I can make better decisions that are truer to myself because they align with my purpose, principles, and values.

So, frequent repetition of what matters to me makes it easier to recognize the things that apply in making my life purposeful. And when something isn't a priority, I can quickly let it go or even ignore it entirely.

However, there is the downside of my ignoring things. People who consider everything necessary or have difficulty understanding their priorities often think I don't care about stuff in general.

And in a way, they are right. I know exactly what I care about and leave the rest to those who do care about those things.

### Second response: How has meditation contributed to your purposeful living, and can you provide an example of how it has affected a decision or outcome in your life?

Meditation has come to help me know the moment of now. To be aware of this time, I'm a part of it. Instead of allowing my mind to have constant interruptions, it recognizes that there are things to deal with and allows me to do something with them.

Before introducing meditation to my life, I thought it was something flaky people did to feel at one with the universe or something. Yet, now that I'm a meditator, though I don't consider it in the traditional sense, I'm more in the flow of life than before.

Previously, my mind would have so many thoughts going off at any given time that it was difficult to know what was necessary. Making it a challenge to complete something, or even when done, getting it done well.

Now, while I hear my wife listening to a TV show, these words that I'm writing to respond to about meditation are at the forefront of my mind. Meditation has allowed me to find peace or calm amidst distractions to bring forward the energy to do well at what I desire.

How has your commitment to financial freedom improved your well-being and future outlook?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite 2008 being a year in which I averaged earning $30,000 a month, I lost my beautiful home, Volvo S80, Kawasaki Ninja 650R, and much else because of failed business contracts. Leaving me $380,000 in debt that took a decade to get out of.

With a high income coming in, living materialistically, and thinking that nothing wrong will happen because I make the minimum payments, I set myself up for a big fall.

That fall included breaking trust with my spouse, who lost their sense of financial security. Something that I only understood years later.

With such an enormous debt load, life choices feel limiting. No longer could grabbing a pizza and a Coke be carefree. Every expense had to be considered carefully.

When not keeping up with timely debt payments, harassing phone calls and dooming stress arise.

Fortunately, being a knowledge worker provides flexibility to generate income through variable-term contracts for various outcomes like hosting server optimization, website development, or being an accountant.

So, while I wasn't positioned for a great-paying regular gig, I could cobble together multiple opportunities that let me lead a calmer life while paying off my massive debt.

Along the way, I finally budgeted my recurring income and expenses, plus how to handle ad hoc revenue. In doing so, I found pleasure in finding out what could be done with limited funds, especially travel.

For example, where my first trips to Europe cost $200 a day, I found a way to enjoy a week's stay in Italy for under $100/week, including my then-wife.

In time, through cash-based budgeting and saving for specific reasons, I began to have more funds available than possible.

Further, I felt freer to take reasonable risks or work less than before. Allowing me to pursue interests other than financial motivations.

Interestingly, such was the start of slow traveling as a family. Instead of chasing a night here and there in tourist destinations, we'd stay for a few nights to a month in a location and live as locals. Allowing my then-wife and I to appreciate better what a culture offers.

In turn, I found greater fulfillment in my work because each location provided me with differing perspectives and helped begin my investment into welcoming and supportive environments for people.

### Second response: How has your commitment to financial freedom improved your well-being and future outlook?

I used to be $380,000 in debt and had nothing to show for it, not even the house that was part of that amount.

Further, I spent so much time attempting to make money to pay for what I no longer had that I didn't enjoy the time doing stuff I used to enjoy.

The path forward is dark and depressing when you are so far in debt. And the way out seems so far away.

At some point, I realized that I had to be doing something positive for myself with the money I earned than watching it all go to others for my past actions.

In turn, I swallowed my pride and approached others for help getting out of debt, even recognizing that I couldn't get out of some debt even when it would be paid off in full.

In moving past my ego of materialism mattered, I found that living more simply was within my means. And as I shifted from living for things to living by experiences, my life felt more meaningful.

It wasn't my clothes or the car I drove that drove my self-worth, but I learned it was how I felt about myself.

And when I became okay with having little and putting my money into the things that mattered to me, I finally felt at peace with money.

How do you find joy in physical activities now compared to the more intense pursuits of your past?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I published, "I thought turning 40 was rough with slowing down. At 50, I'm slow and don't go any faster," reflecting how I feel about getting from point A to point B as I age.

I must do my best to stay moving and flexible for simple things in aging. So many things that were previously trivial aren't now.

Like getting out of bed, standing up from a chair, going to the bathroom, getting into the car, putting together furniture, riding a bicycle, playing with my kids, taking a hike, and hugging my wife.

Each of those simple-seeming activities incurs some form of pain for me. Yet, I persevere because they are expressions of living fully.

When I was younger, I could push myself so hard in running and cycling, be hurt, yet continue for a while. It was a point of pride.

However, those early choices mean that my options now are limited. And so, moving for the joy of it means just that.

Move however I can, thankful that thoughtless movements of the past are still possible, albeit encumbered and slowly.

### Second response: How do you find joy in physical activities now compared to the more intense pursuits of your past?

You only realize the importance of a flexible body once you no longer have it. I have six back injuries from playing hard earlier in my life that make it incredibly difficult to care for myself every day.

I struggle to clean up after number two, even with daily stretching. Leaving me incredibly thankful for bidets and water hoses.

Past that embarrassment, walking around with a small backpack filled with clothes for a few hours while traveling leaves my back and knees very sore. And walking is something we do daily.

Yet, it's something I have to be careful with as well, For I can incapacitate myself with an extremely sore back, inflamed hips, or locked-up knees.

My past found me fairly active, whether in the military training for triathlons or later cycling hundreds of kilometers a week through hills and mountains.

Today, though, I'm grateful to get vertical each morning and move for the joy of it.

Some mornings, my bike ride to the gym ends up just being a longer bike ride. Times at the gym might be silly stretching moves just because they feel good.

Yet, each has limits. Cycling on rugged surfaces causes sharp pains in my lower back. Intense gym movement must be cautioned because my heart can't keep up with the required blood flow. Leading me to pass out.

And so, I don't target the time or intensity of a daily workout. Instead, I find joy in moving to live a full life, even when I might have to move differently than others.

What strategies do you use to ensure your relationships contribute positively to your life?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was difficult to realize that the person I loved the most was the one who hurt me the most. And while I thought then, it wasn't intentional. It was a choice kept.

I didn't find the first part of that realization until a couple of years into my self-development in hopes of reconciling my then 18-year relationship.

Today's world has significant knowledge at our fingertips, and our extreme interactions are easily known to the world through social media.

Therefore, the treatment of people without respect is shifting from being a position of ignorance to a choice of arrogance.

Further, I'm striving to have meaningful relationships with people I care for or am inspired by because I have found that I grow toward being a better person through those interactions.

The hard part about relationships these days is choosing which to pursue. And often, that means returning to my points of consideration and breaking social norms.

Blood family bonds are typically seen as involuntary. Yet those bonds sometimes must be broken the most, for they are the unconscious root of many behaviors.

And so, I found myself distancing myself from dad and mom.

In friends, those who left me feeling drained or disrespectfully challenged my values became the next folks in my life to let go.

While I feared being alone, I found that the remaining people became stronger companions. And with letting go of poor relationships, I was open to new ones of a better quality.

I learned to be a better friend with the better choices of people I interacted with. Listen more heartedly, share burdens more fully, and be present in the company.

### Second response: What strategies do you use to ensure the relationships you keep contribute positively to your life?

My wife recently asked me about friendships from my childhood and military days, to which I responded I don't have any that remain. It's because I didn't realize the value of personal relationships until much later in my life.

I grew up in a transitory environment, as proven by attending three different schools for second grade in two US states.

Next, I try to remember seeing my family members have friends over. Sure, I would hear they are meeting with friends, but seeing the interactions, nada.

And I grew up where my father was often gone. And when they were around, the interactions generally were only positive 40 years later. Even then, I kept a distance between us.

These days, to have a good relationship, you have to work at it. To provide space for others to share of themselves. And be putting as much energy into conversations or sharing as your partners do, if not more.

That does not mean that one-sided giving is the right choice, but recognizing that sometimes you must give more of yourself to get something in return.

A few moments of me being physically present and listening quietly to a friend or loved one talk of their work struggles let them know that I care about their situation.

I'm not going to side with a particular party involved. Instead, I'll ask my friends how they feel about things and what they would like to do, and in turn, support them through whatever they'd like to push toward without me adversely affecting their choices.

It's more about helping them understand the situation, how it came to be, and how they move forward.

My better relationships are the ones where conversations range widely, from intense, emotional moments to casual disregarding each other's coffee and tea preferences. Yet still acquiring what the other likes when it comes to consuming something.

And for the best relationships, it's presence, not words that mean much.

For example, I'm on a weekend away with my wife, and we've chatted throughout the weekend. Yet now, they're watching a TV show in bed, and I'm writing these words. And we're grateful to each other for being nearby. Knowing that being here is a choice we both want, though recognizing we have our things to do now, and respecting those differences freely.

Could you recount when your leadership directly influenced a move towards simplicity and innovation?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Making things easy is one of the hardest things I do because there can be so many approaches to accomplishing a task at home and work.

Convenience is a great way to get customers to adopt. Just think about pre-made meals or, even better, fast food.

Getting to the end goal or desired outcome faster will bring folks in quicker because they have less to think about and do.

I consider myself productively lazy. While I'm willing to work hard at something, when it becomes repeated, I get bored. And that's when the trouble begins.

Because a bored Michael isn't a productive Michael, I'll probably wander off and do something else. Even leaving a task undone.

Sure, I can force myself through to some form of completion. Yet I fear it might not be my best effort, though it will likely be good enough.

And so, since I want to get to the next exciting task or enjoy recurring things, I strive to find ways to make things frictionless.

For example, over the past year, I've been ramping up myself in the public domain through my ImMichaelCannon persona. To create trust in Axelerant as an agency partner through #Automation, #Empowerment, and #AxelerantLifestyle stories.

This effort requires researching, evaluating, and sharing my findings and suggestions. As a weekly task for a singular posting, that's okay.

However, how do you handle reading ten to twenty articles daily and selecting the top three for a daily social media posting?

Now, do that across multiple social networks every day of the week, except weekends.

No weekends because I typically don't work those and don't want people who follow me to think they have to, too.

Frankly, I stop and figure out what's happening and what I want to accomplish. Plus, it's time to be more picky about what I'm doing in authentically creating and sharing where.

Now, let's introduce generative AI.

Looking back, Plato wrote, "Our need will be the real creator," becoming the modern-day English proverb "Necessity is the mother of invention."

The first version of something is an invention, and the following versions are either iterative or innovative depending upon how much change is involved, including that of mindset.

For a long time, the content creation process has been to sit down and write, edit, create a layout, apply typography, edit some more, and publish. A process that's more quickly written down than performed.

When the topic is something I am enthusiastic about, the first few times, I can get myself through it. Yet soon, my mind started playing games with me: I don't have to do this; nobody cares, nobody will notice, and worst of all, this is boring.

Even here, at this point of sharing, I'm hitting the slump, and it's a struggle to keep going because I know if I stop, I'll be lucky to pick this up tomorrow until completion.

Marketing is about getting noticed and accomplishing a call to action. With social networking, consistent presence and engagement are required to maintain an active audience.

Therefore, making the content creation process tolerable and enjoyable is critical to expanding my ImMichaelCannon persona awareness.

It's shifting the content creation process from a tabletop struggle for one piece to preparing many, making the problem simpler and innovative.

Now, I focus on finding and reading articles on the topics I'm interested in and using a form to track those I'd like to share with others.

Then, automation monitors the form list to create suggestions for each submission. These might be simple social shares, educational summaries, or my favorite opinion pieces. And as a bonus, create imagery.

Each content suggestion is based on my perspective by background and intent, plus my preferred tone and style. Further, the content has had one round of automated editing before arriving to me in Slack.

From Slack, the longer form content is dropped into Grammarly for further personalized refinement. Once the content is good enough, it's published immediately or pushed to another form for later downloading.

When it comes time to bulk schedule content, another automation will check the submissions to build social network-specific CSV downloads. To even include chunking long-form Twitter content into smaller tweets.

The outcome of streamlining the reading, picking topics, and readying them for publishing means that I enjoy the process versus feeling weary or, worse, not productive.

In a recent two-hour block of time, I crafted ten educational shares for immediate publishing and another ten opinion pieces with images for bulk scheduling. Previously, I would struggle for 15 to 45 minutes to create a 200-word opinion piece and no educational share.

Nowadays, I enjoy reading more than before because it's easy to share meaningfully. And sometimes, I accidentally schedule a whole month of content in advance.

Even better, my system, version 4, is usable by anyone at Axelerant. And nobody told me to build this system. I did it myself to spend my time more wisely and enable others to do so.

Therefore, leadership and innovation are close friends in organizational advancement.

How do you consistently remind yourself to live intentionally, and what advice would you give to others striving for such a life?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few weeks ago, during a leadership refresher course, I was reminded of how perceptions affect our mindset. In particular, I had been feeling ashamed of the fat my body had added and how I was not studying foreign languages as much as I could.

I felt that I should be skinnier and more fluent in Chinese conversations. However, while my mind was slowing action down, my view hadn't caught up.

So when coach Nanditha mentioned that the statements about our negative self-views might use the word could instead of should. I felt an epiphany and a lightening of stress.

Learning to accept this moment as is and being comfortable with it is a difficult choice. I realized that at this time, I was pushing myself into a stressful situation.

The kind of fat buildup around my face and stomach tends to be cortisol-based. Elevated cortisol levels happen when high-stress levels endure. So, while thinking I wasn't stressed, I have been for a long while.

So, realizing that I could be skinnier and more fluent in Chinese than I should, I felt calmer and more accepting of the situation.

And go figure; I found myself studying another chapter on business Chinese the following morning because I was more interested again than I had to.

And for feeling fatty, am I dieting? Nope, I'm walking to get away from the office and aiming for a better bedtime.

Choices, whether we consider them deliberate or not, affect us. So, as I held an ideal vision of myself in the hopes of inspiring myself to improve, there can be bad outcomes of good intent.

Therefore, we must be conscious of our life choices to ensure that good intent with positive outcomes happens.

And it's conscious choices that I strive for daily to ensure that I'm intentionally living rather than being aimless.

In fact, by knowing my choice boundaries by principles and values, I feel free to try things I hadn't before because my boundaries are based on the known rather than the unknown.

And when something new that doesn't fit me happens, I adjust my boundaries and keep moving forward.

Further, my daily reminder of consciousness and intentionality only takes a minute to mentally review seven things: my purpose, principles, and values.

And when I want to reflect more, I'll include their traits, too, adding a few minutes. Ultimately, I am present to see what my head or heart is trying to tell me.

How did the initial conversations with a life coach at work catalyze your understanding of ownership in your personal life?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Intent: To draw a parallel between professional growth and personal enlightenment, illustrating the transformative power of coaching.

-   Example: Describe the moment of epiphany during a coaching session that led you to reconsider your role in your home life's happiness.

I had spent many years quietly angry with my life and the world around me. I thought that I was giving my best and yet despite that I couldn't connect with the people I cared for back then. Nor could I achieve genuine happiness; one that existed longer than a moment.

My anger had built up for over a decade and I hadn't realized it, in how it affected my life. I could have a moment of peace, to enjoy something, like a kind dinner with a loved one. Yet in leaving, I'd get upset with the traffic on the way home and not find that peace again for a while.

I even found myself angry in agreeing to attempt children, to include wall punching. I think those concrete wall knuckle divots still exist too.

Stepping back, I grew up being yelled at, a lot. And often that hollering would be accompanied by being hit too.

So while I was angry, I was proud of myself for only rarely being physically violent. I would direct my anger through body motion and being intensely loud.

I had thought that keeping the anger non-violent, that everything was okay. And for over a decade, I was that angry person, constantly at turmoil inside.

A couple years later, when Mridula joined Axelerant, while I had hired them and was their boss, I had done so because Ankur had convinced me that a life coach for our folks was something that we should do and help people become more of who they desired to be.

And while I wanted them to help our team members, I'd decline our conversations outside of getting to know each other and the manager types.

Every few weeks, they'd ask about having a chat and I'd pass.

Maybe about six months into Mridula as our 35th employee at Axelerant, I felt much positivity and calmness arising from our people. And the oft happening high turn over of employees seemed to decline.

By those outcomes, I begun to feel that there might be something there in talking with others. For though I thought I was in a fairy tale relationship with Peichi, I was beginning to feel a disconnect and anger for not knowing how to handle the situation.

So when I next had a manager chat with Mridula, and they asked about my having something to chat about, I relented and began to share what I was feeling.

It also around this time that Ankur and I were talking about leadership development because we were feeling not sure how to sustainably grow Axelerant for our little boutique web development was getting bigger than anything we had handled before.

Therefore between seeing two people I had become to admire for their life reflections, I finally became open myself to doing the same.

To recognize my involvement in my life choices, as being the origin of my outcomes than pretending to be a bystander or even a leaf on the wind. To finally know that whatever was happening wasn't being done to me, but because I allowed myself to respond in the ways I had.

And the real moment of insight was realizing that many of us people were just as clueless about our ability to choose how we respond for we've been conditioned by social peer pressure to act otherwise.

And so, Ankur and Mridula have my eternal gratitude for helping me become who I am today, and to inspire others as they are a reflection of my belief that we can own what we do.
