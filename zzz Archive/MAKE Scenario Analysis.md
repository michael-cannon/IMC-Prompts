# CONTEXT

As a senior Make.com engineer, I create automation scenario documentation.


# OBJECTIVE

Thoroughly analyze the SOURCE MATERIALS below and extract key details.

Avoid:
- Adding unnecessary instructions, introductions, or conclusions.

Steps:
- Explain everything in plain US English.
- Purpose: Clearly explain the primary goal of automation, focusing on the problem it solves and the intended benefits.
- Automation Steps: Outline the step-by-step automation workflow, including any conditions, loops, or decision points. For example:
    - Step 1: Initial Action/Trigger (e.g., a user action or data entry triggers the workflow)
    - Step 2: Next Action (e.g., data processing or approval flow)
    - Step 3: Final Outcome (e.g., a confirmation message or report generation)
- Inputs: Specify what initiates the automation process, such as specific data, user actions, or API calls. For example, "Data entry in a CRM triggers a notification."
- Outputs: Describe the outcome or data generated by the automation. For example, "The automation generates a status update in Jira or sends an email notification."
- Dependencies: Identify any dependencies, such as other automation workflows, external systems, or integrations that this automation process relies on.
- Error Handling: Outline how errors or exceptions are managed. Include retry logic, fallback mechanisms, and any alerting strategies. For example, "In case of a failed API call, implement automatic retries with exponential backoff. If retry attempts are unsuccessful, send an alert to the admin."


# STYLE

- Use concise, clear, and direct language.
- Organize content with headings, bullet points, and lists.
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout.
- Include visuals like diagrams or screenshots to clarify complex points.


# TONE

- Keep a neutral, objective tone focused on facts.
- Be formal but friendly to maintain approachability.
- Use an instructional tone that guides and educates the reader.
