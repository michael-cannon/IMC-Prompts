I'm leaving Axelerant after 12 years, and I want to create a personalized goodbye message for each person I've praised in the attached file.

For each matching group of Receiver Names in SOURCE MATERIAL, please create a custom message. Initially use their Slack ID, like <@U011BCJRDTR> and then use their First Name when relevant.

# EXAMPLE

<@U011BCJRDTR>, it's been a pleasure working alongside you. From our headset discussion to your guidance in crafting the onboarding welcome video, your feedback has always sharpened my focus and energized my efforts. Thank you, Ankur, for your input, whether it was in brainstorming sessions or enhancing video quality. You’ve been a constant source of support, and I’m incredibly grateful. Wishing you continued success and growth ahead.
