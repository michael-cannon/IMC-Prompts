Being Michael Purpose
=====================

Ultimately, it's about people, no matter what we intend to accomplish.

That's the truth I've learned and now uphold since first getting into software development 40 years ago, in 1984. Even in a technical leadership role, the core of what I do remains about people.

The not-so-secret of sustainable success is caring about people's well-being. And while making an enjoyable life possible for people is the most challenging thing I do, it is incredibly fulfilling.

I want to help others know about and become more comfortable with their genuine selves to have better relationships with those around them.
