# EXAMPLE OUTPUT

This is how 73,169 people ended up following me: 

It all started in 2022 when I realised two harsh truths: 

- Most 9 to 5's are basically modern slavery. 
- Most physical businesses require a serious amount of capital. 

I knew I did not want to be a slave and I knew I did not have the investment to start another physical business. 

But lucky for me it wasn't 1951. 

LinkedIn was changing the game! 

Attention had become the new currency and Building an Audience was the new Gold! 

So I started building my brand on LinkedIn in 2022: 

The results were Mind-blowing: 

By the end of 2022 I had: 

- Earnt well over 6 figures, 
- Gained tens of millions of views, 
- Helped 9000+ people with their LinkedIn
- Ranked THE Best Personal brander in the world

My method was simple: 

I researched those winning on LinkedIn and shared their secrets with those who wanted to win. 

I gained 73,000+ followers because I helped others gain tens of thousands of followers along the way! 

Here are three ways I can help you too: 

1. For those starting out I recommend subscribing to my newsletter "The Creator Bizz". Everyone talks about how much money they make with their creator businesses but no one shows us how! In this newsletter I showcase the people doing it successfully so you can learn EXACTLY how they built their own profitable Creator businesses! 

2. For those ready to get going with their own Journey I recommend taking my FREE Robinhood course. This is where I finally decided to compile all my learnings into a detailed video course and give it out to all my followers as a thank you gift for their support. With over 9000+ STUDENTS and 345+ FIVE STAR ratings, this course is hands down the best and most comprehensive resource to get you started with your online business on LinkedIn! It's free but it was designed from my learnings after spending thousands of dollars into coaching and courses so YOU DON'T have to! (Join via my featured section) 

3. Lastly- We have the infamous LinkedIn Creators Club. This is a community of Content creators that I host and lead where we Learn how to create the best content for our personal brands and our businesses. Keep up with insider trends, learn from Masterclasses, become an Algorithm genius and ask all your questions in our Workshops! With direct access to ME this community is your one stop shop for anyone wanting to succeed with their LinkedIn businesses. (Join via my featured section) 

Want to build an audience of your own? 

Pick one of the three options above!

Open Passport - Michael Cannon - Khet Thon Buri Thailand Nov 05 2019 small.jpg

![](blob:https://axelerant.atlassian.net/a3bf4f73-67b2-428a-9665-51c3c9549bd6#media-blob-url=true&id=566c6f42-f9e4-4197-ae34-10bcbc6dc2e2&collection=contentId-387842062&contextId=387842062&mimeType=image%2Fjpeg&name=Passport%20-%20Michael%20Cannon%20-%20Khet%20Thon%20Buri%20Thailand%20Nov%2005%202019%20small.jpg&size=84037&width=413&height=531&alt=)

Good day, I'm Michael Cannon, a Virgo water rat, Drusus (2013) & Jace's (2016) remote dad, and I lead a full life by conscious choices.

While I have a lofty *Chief Success Officer* job title at Axelerant, my active role is *Director of Intelligent Automation*, which is focused on empowering people and humanizing systems while also raising awareness of Axelerant as a professional services career and partner choice.

I live in Zhubei, south of Taipei in Taiwan, and have attended school or worked in ten other countries. I have visited nearly 40 countries and 300 cities. I've studied eleven languages to a survival level, yet only English and Chinese are active.

0:00 / 0:28

I used to road cycle lots, though a weakened heart now has me walking and hiking uphill slowly. Nearly every day, I read something about business operations, people management, personal development, and fantastical topics, plus sharing the relatable bits.

In the fall of 2008, despite making $30,000 a month, I went into $380,000 in debt while losing my business, home, vehicles, and much more because of my choices. Only $1,000 remained. I have since realized that loss was for the better because the quality of life matters more than stuff.

My first introduction to Axelerant failed in 2010 when brought into Srijan as Chief Operating Officer to merge the two organizations. I failed because I acted as a boss rather than a leader, where ignoring culture and emotional intelligence greatly cost me.

After hitting career bottom, I rose through personal reflection and change to join Axelerant again in February 2013 as its Chief People Officer, team member #11.

My first significant change was establishing 35 days off a year and designating no official holidays. Because no regional, national, religious, or personal beliefs consistently align on when to work.

> Enable outcomes through flexibility.

Since then, I've been a leader in business operations, sales, marketing, customer success, people care, and operations automation. Now, I'm shifting towards a public persona, building awareness of Axelerant as a career and professional services partner.

My work schedule.
-----------------

My schedule fluctuates depending on where I am. Typically, I'm home in Taiwan with my wife for two months out of three. Then, either with my kids in Portland, Maine, United States, or on the road elsewhere.

-   Eastern US 04:30-14:00.

-   India 10:00-18:30.

-   Taiwan 10:00-19:00.

Michael's Meaning of Life
=========================

Open 0787EB86-48DF-4DC3-8E6C-2DEA1AE5596F_1_201_a.jpeg

![](blob:https://axelerant.atlassian.net/e1129d93-35ed-473d-9198-27b3cde15e0d#media-blob-url=true&id=fcef47cd-640d-4807-995b-e0a6c7b127ad&collection=contentId-387842062&contextId=387842062&mimeType=image%2Fjpeg&name=0787EB86-48DF-4DC3-8E6C-2DEA1AE5596F_1_201_a.jpeg&size=1581238&width=2254&height=2225&alt=)

Since young, I've regularly spoken up when others wouldn't, even when it wouldn't go well for me.

To speak or do rightly, I take significant steps to understand people's perspectives to choose well by balancing ethics, fairness, culture, wisdom, etc.

In being different, I have no big dreams because I've chosen to live my ideal life daily than waiting for an unknown future. This stance allows me to live fully now rather than worrying about the past or future.

Deliberate Life Goals
---------------------

-   Be with family.

-   Conversational in Chinese, English, & French.

-   Feel good about me.

-   Retire comfortably by 62.

-   Sustainable ownership--engage, empower, and inspire others to own what they do.

My core expectations
====================

Be a bit better every day.
--------------------------

I'm not the person I was a year ago because I'm actively working towards *being 1% better* daily. That means I'm not making significant changes in my life, just minor habit tweaks or investing in priorities.

Making my bed, meditating, moving around, and consuming tasty, wholesome foods all before work starts come from years of ongoing habit shifts. And I'd be overwhelmed if I suddenly did them all.

I get difficulty. I believe that peer pressure often keeps the things that don't matter to us around. Consider lessening what you think is thought of you to be freer toward choosing what matters for yourself.

Be kind, not nice.
------------------

I'm a compassionate and kind person who will help people move forward and speak genuinely.

I am not a considerate or nice person to say fluffy things to make people feel better.

Host regular, respectful conversations.
---------------------------------------

My entire intent is to develop respect and trust between us continuously. Our conversations will be about your fitting in, priorities, future interests, and helping you succeed.

Conversations with me might make you uncomfortable because I'm curious. I will ask questions about a situation's background, outcomes, and perspectives, not to blame you for it but to better overcome it.

### Keeping in touch with key people.

For whom I'm a reporting manager, our first several 1-1s will be at least bi-weekly before being monthly.

For whom I'm a career manager, our first few 1-1s will be monthly before becoming quarterly.

For both conversation types, I intend to help us build a respectful, trusting relationship to ensure feedback and expectations flow freely.

### Getting to know others.

I'll randomly select team members for a Donut or skip-level conversation each month to learn about you, how your time at Axelerant goes, and what you are doing outside of work.

### My baseline conversation foundations.

-   I sincerely appreciate and respect your courage to discuss hard things with me.

-   I will not personally attack you.

-   I'm present in conversations by minimizing my distractions

-   I'll be empathetic to your situation and in how I share other perspectives

-   I will work with you toward a positive outcome for Axelerant

-   When asked something you don't know, say so. This way, we can both learn.

-   I'm very open; I forget that others aren't and might unintentionally share what others wouldn't.

-   Let me know when I've created an uncomfortable situation so we can recover.

### Word choice matters to me.

I've been in an English as a second language environment for nearly 30 years. As such, the words I use in conversations I care about tend to be precise or assume a shared understanding because miscommunication amongst non-native language communicators too quickly happens.

For example, annoyed and frustrated are words with similar meanings. Yet, I use annoyance when irritated about something I can control. Frustration is used when something is out of my control.

When I say something that doesn't resonate or mean something to you, yet it's felt important, please ask me for clarification.

Practice patience and KISS.
---------------------------

As Axelerant grows, processes are shifting to systems that cross domains. As we scale further, evoking desired change takes more significant time. To keep changes from being forgotten or misunderstood, we must keep them manageable such as keeping information short and simple (KISS).

Deadlines should only exist when they absolutely must. Otherwise, allow a week or two before following up on non-critical matters. And, when urgency is required, do your best to let others know and contribute to getting the right things done.

Practice consistent daily schedules.
------------------------------------

I love my flexible schedule. However, that doesn't mean every day should be a surprise when the right things will be done, being available for calls or taking time with family. When the days of the week need different schedules, that's fine. Just be consistent with them.

Our knowledge work tires us emotionally, mentally, and physically. Therefore, allow recovery time each day, week, and month to ensure energy to stay driven. I keep myself on track through daily meditations, book-reading escapes, monthly travels, and an annual week or more offline.

Even if I think about work during those times, it's okay because I find it's my subconscious helping improve Axelerant and its people.

Also, I don't expect a response when I contact you outside your working hours until you're within your office times. When it's urgent, I'll call you directly.

Speak up for yourself.
----------------------

You are where you are because you are the expert. Not speaking up for things of your domain or interests holds you and Axelerant back. Therefore, I expect you to speak your mind to me and others respectfully. I will do my best to hear, acknowledge, and share with you in the same manner.

### Am I writing about sex?

I'll sometimes write about a gray area topic via [Peimic.com](https://peimic.com/about/ "https://peimic.com/about/") or elsewhere, and I want to share how I guide what's permissible to publish.

I'm a massive fan of [Vishen's work at Mind Valley](https://www.mindvalley.com/ "https://www.mindvalley.com/."), and I would want to do the same for the people they inspire. Therefore, I will not publicly publish something I'm not proud to share with those people.

Use good judgment.
------------------

I don't think writing a guide, policy, or process for every situation is feasible. Therefore, I suggest good judgment in all circumstances, even when it contradicts what I might have said previously.

I trust the person closest to the situation to make the right decision. I might not like how something goes, but there are no repercussions given that there were reasonable efforts toward Axelerant's best interests.

What do Ankur and Michael do?
-----------------------------

Ankur focuses on empowering departments and services.

I focus on sustainability via organizational alignment and excellence through special programs.

Together, we demonstrate [Being Axelerant](https://axelerant.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OA/pages/1447493744) to help team members align through exploration, execution, management, and mentoring of our areas' mindset, people, systems, and tools.

Automation Relationships at Axelerant

Intelligent Automation intends to embrace AI and utilize automation and systemization to minimize manual administrative efforts and focus on what matters to Axelerant and its stakeholders. A reasonable automation effort empowers team members or enables a consistently excellent customer experience through standards of requirements gathering, development, documentation, and testing.

At the root of automation is the requirement to form standards, which requires consistency in what we desire to accomplish with automation. Therefore, to be most successful, we must be conscientious of the information we feed into a system through data accuracy.

Though checklists exist, people can have a bad day and miss a step, potentially making an affected person feel slighted. Or an organization not informed of downtime over a security update while attempting to have a marketing launch. 

These unintended consequences are preventable through systemization, a driving factor of automation. Automation efforts should help people ensure consistency. And through consistent operations, we can consciously change outcomes to those we desire.

Our Solutions
-------------

### Recruitment Automation

-   **Challenge**: Manual and paper-based processes slow down recruitment and pose security risks.

-   **Outcome**: Our automation cuts sourcing to offer time by 86%, doubles job applications, and significantly improves candidate quality.

### Onboarding/Offboarding Efficiency

-   **Outcome**: Automation reduces onboarding time by 83%, saving over 2000 hours annually and significantly improving employee satisfaction.

### Administration and Synchronization

-   **Challenge**: Manual administrative tasks divert attention from strategic initiatives.

-   **Outcome**: Our solutions automate over 30 HR processes, leading to an 85% gain in efficiency and a 12% reduction in labor costs.

Making automation happen at Axelerant

How We Do It
------------

Through a flat team structure of project managers, business analysts, software engineers, and quality assurance folks, our approach to Intelligent Automation is rooted in **Empowerment** and **Efficiency**. We leverage:

-   **Business Process Discovery:** Identifying business operations and processes with the intent to eliminate or improve.

-   **Robotic Process Automation (RPA):** Using structured inputs and logic or trained artificial intelligence (AI) to handle repeatable human tasks.

-   **Organizational Empowerment:** Enabling people and their teams to have greater control and autonomy in their work through minimal, supportive oversight.

-   Systemizing efforts with AI and minimal/no-code tools.

> TLDR I consciously choose who I am and what I do, even when doing so is unpopular.

Hello, I'm Michael Cannon, a boundless Virgo water-rat, Drusus & Jace's remote dad, for [@Axelerant's](https://www.axelerant.com/about) success and living by kind, conscious choices.

A decade ago, I was tired of working for tomorrow and not reaching my dreams. So, I stopped chasing them.

Instead, I decided to live by decomposing dreams into daily tangible bits as actions to become closer to my ideal self.

In other words, I live my future life the best I can now.

In the years since, I've thought much and reframed my purpose, principles, and values, plus their traits. Creating boundaries through them of an aspirational means versus specific actions has worked best for me.

For example, *moving for the joy of it* gets me out of my home for a walk easier than going to the gym thrice weekly as a goal.

More importantly, those life boundaries helped craft my daily life decision framework, which meant making tough choices that eventually made life easier.

Like letting toxic relationships go or recognizing I'm no longer capable of high-impact sports.

Creating holism.
----------------

I base my life purpose, principles, and values around the concepts of why, what, and how.

-   Purpose forms the why.
-   Principles compose the what.
-   Values define the how.

It took about two years of weekly deep reflections before my core principles, values, and traits solidified. Since then, I've been pondering and refining them quarterly.

To start living better by my purpose, I had to recognize myself honestly. Like, I have fat, my ego causes trouble, and while I'm very responsible, I'm not too fond of discipline.

While choices like fasting are part of the *taking better care of myself* principle, they are tricky. 

For example, while I feel great fasting, I can only do it when I'm not relocating. And it took a while to figure out it was not a discipline issue; it was a curiosity because I used to be on the road six to nine months a year.

These days, I eat whatever seems appealing for the first two weeks of a new location. After that, I can fast two or three days a week because curiosity no longer drives my choices.

Balancing intent and actions of principles is an ongoing compromise. Some days will be a miss, like not moving around outside because I'm feeling lazy.

So while it might seem like I've sorted my life out, I've off days just like you.

Being me starts with a purpose.

Live fully by living differently (Why)
--------------------------------------

I'm not interested in living perfectly or following in others' footsteps. I'm interested in what I find curious, enjoyable, and inspiring.

Therefore, given that the moment appeals to my principles and values, it's a good time for me.

My first step and principle in achieving my purpose are that:

### I take better care of myself (What #1)

-   Meditate for alignment
-   Minimize debt
-   Move for the joy of it
-   Munch towards a long and content life
-   Sleep well each day

When I was a cross-country runner or a bomb squad technician, coaches and superiors kept me directed. Now, I must care for myself toward a long, fulfilling life.

I had more specific traits, like a 20-minute workout each day. Yet that felt rigid and, with my dislike for discipline, hard to maintain.

*Moving for the joy of it* is an easier aspiration to partake in when I'm tired or stressed because I can sync that time with a meditation session.

So, shifting something from a must-do to a desire-to-do has dramatically helped me regularly perform self-care.

The second way I fulfill my purpose is to:

### I have healthy relationships (What #2)

-   Associate with whom I care for or am inspired by
-   Courageous in thoughts, words, and deeds
-   Give timely, specific feedback and recognition
-   Give undistracted attention to conversations

It took me until my early-40s to realize that not every relationship deserves my time. Continuing some associations created significant toxicity in my life and affected others.

With a heavy heart, I began evaluating my relationships. I categorized them towards keep or not by helping, hindering, or doing nothing for me.

The most challenging relationship I left was with my wife and best friend of 20 years. Our first 13 years were incredible, yet the latter times found us unable to stay connected despite our best efforts.

Now my relationships are based on recurring, positive life choices. And when I'm with someone, I focus on them and ignore distractions around us.

The third path to my purpose is:

### I am an inspiring leader (What #3)

-   Challenge the status quo
-   Demonstrate gratitude for peers and their supporters
-   Engage and empower people to own what they do
-   Focus on priorities
-   Have reasonable boundaries and expectations for myself and others
-   Share my learnings

I want my work to have joy and meaning. And over time, I have learned that my best work comes alongside great leaders and managers.

I have learned to avoid the boss mode of telling people what to do because that action antagonizes most folks away from our desired outcomes.

Build respect and trust by making time to

-   Learn about one another
-   Reach a mutual purpose
-   Find a meaningful interest
-   Allow the person ownership in doing
-   Follow up

And through that trust and respect, they often remain beside me.

Values Define the Path
----------------------

Three core values define how I consistently act no matter what I'm doing to accomplish my life's purpose.

Beginning with:

### Smile (How #1)

Without speaking, a simple smile conveys welcome, encouragement, and humor. And smiling helps prevent me from judging others and the situations we find ourselves in. Instead, I decide to accept, change, or release myself from challenging moments.

Through smiling, I can begin to build a relationship, leading to my second value:

### Demonstrate Respect (How #2)

Curiosity and respect for our differences are keys to getting along to build trust that allows for challenging conversations. In which a situation can be peacefully discussed with good intent toward positive outcomes.

To help myself demonstrate respect, I follow several specific actions: calm presence, discover impact, and have compassion in moving forward.

Those respectful actions require direction, or else closure remains away. Therefore my third value helps create a mini-why:

### Have Purpose (How #3)

While stating *have purpose* seems recursive, it's a critical reminder of each moment I have. Which has helped me identify my number one value trait.

Consciously choose.

That trait is the foundation of how I act in every moment. And has the positive consequence of me owning everything I do by leading me toward what matters and ignoring the rest.

Next, *having purpose* has helped me realize that I prefer quality of life over a high standard of living; to live well.

Third, to have a purpose, I must know what is possible, which helps me be curious. To expand my horizons, create opportunities for positive change, and sometimes refresh my memory.

Lastly, I act thoughtfully through purpose and conscious choice to reach my intended outcome. And sometimes, that means doing nothing.

Being Me.
---------

My living fully requires recurring reflection. That reflection often leads to determining key actions of immediate priorities and, sometimes, crafting a new direction or perspective.

Authenticity matters in building hope, trust, and inspiration with those around me, which means sharing the good, the bad, and the ugly of ourselves. Leading us to craft stories that others relate to from our most embarrassing and frustrating times.

No matter what, I continue to do my best. And learn from and share the failures. So together, we will do better.

Deliberate Life Goals.
----------------------

-   Be reflective.
-   Be with family.
-   Feel good about me.
-   Retire comfortably by 62.
-   Sustainable ownership--engage, empower, and inspire others to own what they do.
