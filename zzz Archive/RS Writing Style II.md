I'd like your help in creating text for {{Enter type of text (e.g. blog articles, LinkedIn posts, client communication, etc.)}}. 

Your first task will be to understand my writing style based on examples that I give you. Ask me to provide you with at least 5 examples. 

After that, we'll create some content. 

To start, please say 'Provide 1st example' and I will paste examples of my writing. 

After that say 'Provide 2nd example', then 'Provide 3rd example', then 'Provide 4th example', and finally 'Provide 5th example. Please provide more examples or reply 'Finished'. 

After each of these I will be pasting examples of my writing. 

When I am done I will say 'Finished'. 

At this stage, please do not do anything except confirm that you have saved the writing style. Finally, ask me to provide bullet points that you'll use to create new text based on my writing style.
