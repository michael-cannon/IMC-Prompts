Case study - 1 Enterprise-level Retail Megalith: Consolidating DX across 90+ Diverse Brands
===========================================================================================

Services Delivered Site Build & Feature Enhancements

The customer is an enterprise-level retail megalith composed of some of the world's most recognized brands and household names. The franchise currently operates across the whole of Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey with more than 4000 stores, 90 plus consumer retail brands, and 35 years of operations history.\
Our partner Acquia was the primary solution provider and augmented our teams over a multi-year of development and delivery roadmap for the client.

## Business Challenge
Of the nearly 90 brands in the customer's portfolio, some were on Drupal, while others used a mix of open-source and proprietary CMSs. Not all had a web presence. In a lot of Middle Eastern markets, there are no online stores. Most brands here had physical stores. Others had a web presence, but no eCommerce capabilities.

Given all this, there was a lack of standardization across the brands, both in terms of the customers' as well as the editors' experience. It also meant that the client was spending a lot on maintaining and updating these sites while losing precious time in launching new brands online. They needed to consolidate digital experience across their diverse brands.

## Solution

Axelerant came together with Acquia to deliver a front-end solution that would allow clients to launch websites quickly without involving developers.

Acquia Cloud and Acquia Cloud Site Factory (ACSF) hid the provisioning of servers behind a layer so that users don't need to see the complexity involved. Their user-friendly interface allows sites to be deployed easily and effectively without involving developers. This makes the product a great fit for business owners launching in new regions and demographics.

We also helped the Acquia team with fixing bugs and modifying their Drupal-Magento Ecommerce connector module which would bring content from Drupal, Product Management, and retail systems together onto a single interface.

Other key features delivered as part of this solution included an improved Config Management, consistent and effective custom theme management, mobile application API development, Instant Search functionality, A Single Page Checkout, and more.

## Results

All brand sites for the Retail Megalith client were brought onto one platform. The process of maintenance was simplified and the Total Cost of Ownership was significantly reduced.

Automation Relationships at Axelerant

Intelligent Automation intends to embrace AI and utilize automation and systemization to minimize manual administrative efforts and focus on what matters to Axelerant and its stakeholders. A reasonable automation effort empowers team members or enables a consistently excellent customer experience through standards of requirements gathering, development, documentation, and testing.

At the root of automation is the requirement to form standards, which requires consistency in what we desire to accomplish with automation. Therefore, to be most successful, we must be conscientious of the information we feed into a system through onboarding and context-like data accuracy.

### Attention to Detail Matters

For example, "Salesforce Service", "Salesforce Service ", and "Salesforce Services" are the same thing to human eyes. However, for automation platforms like Zapier and Make, those text strings are treated uniquely, like three different kinds of information.

Therefore, when information goes into a platform such as Zoho People like extra spaces "", plurals "s", inconsistent naming "Director, ..." vs. "Director of..." can cause stoppages in our automation, unintended outcomes, incorrect options, or difficult to track errors.

### Bad Days Happen

Though checklists exist, people can have a bad day and miss a step, potentially making an affected person feel slighted. Or an organization not informed of downtime over a security update while attempting to have a marketing launch. 

These unintended consequences are preventable through systemization, a driving factor of automation. Automation efforts should help people ensure consistency. And through consistent operations, we can consciously change outcomes to those we desire.

Our Solutions
-------------

### Recruitment Automation

-   **Challenge**: Manual and paper-based processes slow down recruitment and pose security risks.

-   **Outcome**: Our automation cuts sourcing to offer time by 86%, doubles job applications, and significantly improves candidate quality.

### Onboarding/Offboarding Efficiency

-   **Challenge**: Lengthy, error-prone onboarding processes that waste valuable resources.

-   **Outcome**: Automation reduces onboarding time by 83%, saving over 2000 hours annually and significantly improving employee satisfaction.

### Administration and Synchronization

-   **Challenge**: Manual administrative tasks divert attention from strategic initiatives.

-   **Outcome**: Our solutions automate over 30 HR processes, leading to an 85% gain in efficiency and a 12% reduction in labor costs.

Making automation happen at Axelerant

How We Do It
------------

Through a flat team structure of project managers, business analysts, software engineers, and quality assurance folks, our approach to Intelligent Automation is rooted in **Empowerment** and **Efficiency**. We leverage:

-   **Business Process Discovery:** Identifying business operations and processes with the intent to eliminate or improve.

-   **Robotic Process Automation (RPA):** Using structured inputs and logic or trained artificial intelligence (AI) to handle repeatable human tasks.

-   **Organizational Empowerment:** Enabling people and their teams to have greater control and autonomy in their work through minimal, supportive oversight.

-   Systemizing efforts with AI and minimal/no-code tools.

Our Process: From Discovery to Support
--------------------------------------

1.  **Discovery**: Identify inefficiencies and set goals.

2.  **Planning**: Target high-impact initiatives for quick wins.

3.  **Design**: Redesign processes for efficiency and tech integration.

4.  **Build**: Implement automation for effective workflows.

5.  **Testing & QA**: Ensure goals are met and get stakeholder approval.

6.  **Deployment**: Launch new processes with full support and training.

7.  **Monitoring & Support**: Provide ongoing oversight and improvement.

We have gained in-depth experience working with higher education institutions, including Stanford University, [State Universities of New York (SUNY) Maritime College](https://www.axelerant.com/success-stories/suny-maritime-college-drupal-migration), and [A Prominent Research University in the United States](https://www.axelerant.com/success-stories/quality-assurance/higher-education/drupal-qa), apart from the [University of East London](https://www.axelerant.com/success-stories/dxp-for-university-of-east-london).

We've been working with [Openscholar LLC](https://www.axelerant.com/success-stories/quality-assurance/higher-education/test-automation) in upgrading and enhancing their Drupal-powered website-building distributed platform for Higher Ed since December 2018. The platform we enhanced powers the websites of Harvard University, Princeton University, Rice University, Olin College of Engineering, University of Virginia, Broad Institute, and many other leading institutions.

We understand that Higher ed leaders need to look far beyond immediate challenges and build effective long-term solutions to attract, engage, and delight their stakeholders: students, parents, and faculty---and the engagement journey starts and continues with your website. Through our experience and research, we have developed a detailed understanding of [Open Source technologies in higher education](https://www.axelerant.com/blog/education-content-management-system), covering aspects such as Marketing, Accessibility, Personalization, Security, Multisite architectures, and more.  With a substantial experience of this kind, we believe a partnership with us can tremendously impact your goals.

Expertise with Accessibility. We implement 508 and WCAG-compliant websites so that people with all types of disabilities can access our sites, whether physical, mental, or visual impairment. We use tools like aXe and Lighthouse during the development and as a part of Continuous Integration (CI) to verify that all the components are AA/AAA compliant. We have a dedicated [checklist for Accessibility testing](https://www.axelerant.com/blog/a-qa-engineers-perspective-to-accessibility-testing).

We helped make a [Multinational Supermarket's E-commerce Platform Accessible](https://www.axelerant.com/success-stories/frontend/retail/accessibility), [Built accessible websites for a consumer goods manufacturer](https://www.axelerant.com/success-stories/quality-assurance/consumer-brands/accessibility-testing), apart from helping UEL rank 22nd from the previous 100+ rank among UK universities per Silktide's rating.

Experience with React. We have tons of experience with modern JavaScript frameworks like React. We have built highly interactive, scalable, accessible, and high-performance applications. We understand that the motivation to consider React is for certain performance improvements. We helped a [large retail megalith having 90+ brands](https://www.axelerant.com/success-stories/frontend/retail/franchise) improve checkout process performance by progressively decoupling with React and are confident of doing the same for UEL. We also built a [Powerful tool to facilitate Team retrospectives](https://www.axelerant.com/success-stories/frontend/high-tech/javascript) and a [Prediction Pro ](https://www.axelerant.com/blog/axelerant-ipl-prediction-pro-prediction-game) game using React.

We also have been actively involved within the JAMStack and Decoupled Drupal community. We have internal Slack channels like #learn-club-react to promote and share learnings around React and other frontend frameworks.

Case study - 1 Enterprise-level Retail Megalith: Consolidating DX across 90+ Diverse Brands
===========================================================================================

Services Delivered Site Build & Feature Enhancements

The customer is an enterprise-level retail megalith composed of some of the world's most recognized brands and household names. The franchise currently operates across the whole of Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey with more than 4000 stores, 90 plus consumer retail brands, and 35 years of operations history.\
Our partner Acquia was the primary solution provider and augmented our teams over a multi-year of development and delivery roadmap for the client.

## Business Challenge
Of the nearly 90 brands in the customer's portfolio, some were on Drupal, while others used a mix of open-source and proprietary CMSs. Not all had a web presence. In a lot of Middle Eastern markets, there are no online stores. Most brands here had physical stores. Others had a web presence, but no eCommerce capabilities.

Given all this, there was a lack of standardization across the brands, both in terms of the customers' as well as the editors' experience. It also meant that the client was spending a lot on maintaining and updating these sites while losing precious time in launching new brands online. They needed to consolidate digital experience across their diverse brands.

## Solution

Axelerant came together with Acquia to deliver a front-end solution that would allow clients to launch websites quickly without involving developers.

Acquia Cloud and Acquia Cloud Site Factory (ACSF) hid the provisioning of servers behind a layer so that users don't need to see the complexity involved. Their user-friendly interface allows sites to be deployed easily and effectively without involving developers. This makes the product a great fit for business owners launching in new regions and demographics.

We also helped the Acquia team with fixing bugs and modifying their Drupal-Magento Ecommerce connector module which would bring content from Drupal, Product Management, and retail systems together onto a single interface.

Other key features delivered as part of this solution included an improved Config Management, consistent and effective custom theme management, mobile application API development, Instant Search functionality, A Single Page Checkout, and more.

## Results

All brand sites for the Retail Megalith client were brought onto one platform. The process of maintenance was simplified and the Total Cost of Ownership was significantly reduced.

Case Study - 2 Sales Experience & Marketing Automation Drupal Acquia Platform for Insurance Services
===========================================================================================

Services Delivered Site Build & Feature Enhancements

The customer is an is a leader and pioneer in insurance products and marketing service administration. Team FM is a team of innovative and customer-oriented insurance industry experts and marketing specialists.

With over half a century of experience, this Tennessee-based business offers a diverse suite of consumer insurance programs to individuals and families. Through its brand partners, FM helps banks and credit unions bring new levels of protection and peace of mind to their consumers.

## Business Challenge\
With a vendor and customer database which was huge, it wasn't easy for their team to manage everything all at once.

Because key functionalities were missing from this platform, Customer's developers were overburdened with manual tasks. Main challenges included:

-   Navigation inconsistencies and information islands caused by separate systems for sales and service teams

-   Limited CMS capabilities

-   Manual creation of microsites for insurance vendors

-   Limited scalability 

-   Manual tracking of site customizations for microsites

-   The inability to view multi website data and traffic analytics in a single dashboard

## Solution (Drupal and Acquia comprised the stack)

We took a hyper-collaborative approach along with the customer team to align to their short-term and long-term vision.

Together, we would engineer a digital platform that unifies Service Experience, and Marketing Automation. It would especially make the production and customization of microsites easy. We'd achieve this goal by revamping two of their critical digital properties including:

Sales Experience Platform: We migrated the homegrown legacy CMS to the new Drupal CMS and Acquia Site Studio. Our team created a set of defined templates that can be used by account managers, marketers, and other non-technical teams. It enables them to launch microsites quickly for new customers, to sell new products, and to run cross-sell campaigns, etc. We also implemented multi-level roll-up analytics through Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager.

Marketing Automation Platform: We've also conducted discovery, analysis, and deliberations on how Acquia Campaign Studio can be used to automate the  marketing experience platform. With this, their vendors could start using email as a channel of engagement to connect with prospects, get end-users to sign-up for new programs, and to improve the platform's conversion rate.

## Results

The  platform now has a fast-performing platform that helps achieve scalable microsite creation and validation with minimal effort. 

-   The platform is built for scalability. It can cater to thousands of more vendors and customers. 

-   Its responsiveness enables intuitive content authoring. 

-   It has also helped reduce the time from a few days to a few minutes to spin up the new microsites without any intervention from the development team members.

-   Custom feature development and deployment for customers takes just a few minutes, thanks to automation.

Case study - 3 Serverless, Decoupled Drupal With A Hybrid Cloud Approach For A Global Resort Developer
===========================================================================================

Services Delivered Implementing Multilingual, Headless, Serverless Drupal

We helped a luxury resort client consolidate their different web properties onto a single platform. This enables them to offer their users modern content experiences faster, to market themselves better, and to become more profitable.

## Business Challenge

The client was facing issues due to their previously disjointed efforts in the digital technology ecosystem. They were not using any specific technologies across their web properties, and this left them with a very unstructured approach to content management.

They were still running basic, outdated HTML/CSS websites and their content was effectively scattered across different HTML files. It became impossible to effectively manage this kind of architecture beyond a certain point---these platforms were not future-ready.

The client wanted to set up a Content Management System (CMS) so that a single solution would answer the content management needs for all their brands. They needed a multi-site solution.

## Solution

Axelerant's skills and experience, backed by Acquia and our alignment with the client's ambitions made us the right choice to support Wunderman through this implementation.

The client decided to use decoupled Drupal with Acquia Site Factory---so that their different websites could have the same base but also an easily manageable content structure---with the latest version of Angular on the front end. Unlike conventional decoupled Drupal for enterprise which is usually hosted in the Acquia Cloud Platform, this implementation brought in several other elements that make the architecture unique.

Decoupled Drupal instances are still not very popular, and each such setup tends to be unique. In this instance, Axelerant implemented an Angular-based front-end and a headless Drupal site.

Different Regions To Address. Since the client is a luxury resort chain, they had different regions to address. Content needed to reside closer to the user in a central base. Eg. Content in India would need to use a server in Mumbai. Hence, Amazon CloudFront became a consideration.

Large Number Of Brands. Additionally, as a luxury resort chain, the client had multiple sites serving a number of brands. These needed to be unified with Acquia Cloud Site Factory rather than plain vanilla Drupal in order to establish a common backend with multilingual versions.

Multicloud Architecture. The target audience was based mainly in China. Internet access in China is restricted, meaning there are delays to sites hosted outside the country, so we implemented an API layer connection between Amazon Web Services (AWS) along with Aliyun (Alibaba's cloud offering) to expedite.

Amazon Web Services And Aliyun. As the client was present in multiple locations, we had to choose a CloudFront distribution. But that wasn't all.

Due to the hosting restrictions imposed by the Chinese government, all sites needed to be hosted in two places. The .com version of the website is served by AWS and is located in Singapore with the API hosted on CloudFront. The Aliyun website is hosted in a region called Shenzhen in China, and accessible through Aliyun's CDN offering.

## Results

Global reach through the multi-cloud approach. Our hybrid cloud approach enables the client to serve content worldwide, including key markets like China. The code is modularized so that a single Terraform script is able to handle both the AWS and Aliyun clouds.

Faster, effective multilingual content. The client is now able to serve multilingual content (via Lambda as the proxy) to all its brands through a unified backend, with much faster content delivery. Elements get cached in the frontend and API responses are faster.

"Axelerant shows much more professionalism and expertise than others.The client is very happy... we love working with them."

Case study - 4  How We Helped Accelerate Site Creation For A Fortune 200 Life Sciences Company
===========================================================================================

With 400+ companies in almost 100 countries and a focus in healthcare and agriculture, this life sciences leader is known for innovative R&D activities focused on preventing and treating diseases around the world. It is also a supplier of quality animal feed and organic materials and more.

## Business Challenge

The customer needed to create a large number of websites (approximately 1500) for its varied brands in different geographies. 

Prior to working with an Acquia and Axelerant partnership, the customer had been working with another vendor using Site Factory. Unfortunately, their users in local markets and brand agencies were facing difficulties with the more technical aspects of Drupal and Site Factory, and the velocity of site deployment was slower than expected.

## Solution

The Website Factory is a tool that the customer wanted to allow users to build and manage sites in a consolidated UI. This would involve Drupal, Site Studio, decoupled components, and a Self Service Portal (SSP) to accelerate site building. 

Creating a package and a set of components for one group of sites was significantly faster than creating a theme by doing actual development. The team chose the automated Site Studio package import mechanism during site installation and update to manage Site Studio configurations. In this system, while Site Factory handles site creation and the backend is handled by Drupal, Site Studio substitutes the theming effort completely, adding extra features like a ready to use content editor, enabling users to create content and style it. 

All users have to do is go to the tool, initiate the site creation process, choose which site template to use (this will instruct Site Factory to create a site with that profile), and then select which Site Studio package to use. 

At the beginning of the engagement, there were around 2,000 bugs that had accumulated over a period of time. Through this engagement, we were able to provide the customer with a stable platform, high velocity site creation, and fewer issues reported.

## Results

Site creation is now easier, faster, and more flexible than ever. The use of reusable site templates allows for better control over the management of site design/UI. The powerful and extensible personalization solution ensures taking the users through a journey and content that are relevant to them.

Case study - 5  How We Migrated Millions Of Content Items To Drupal For Lonely Planet
===========================================================================================

The customer in the Media and Entertainment is one of the best known names in the world. They provide extensive resources for travelers to destinations all around the world, including their famed travel guide books, web content, mobile apps, as well as a thriving online community of travelers 

## Business Challenge

Lonely Planet needed to upgrade their legacy website, which was over a decade old and had been custom built on [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). They were facing multiple issues with caching and site scalability. The solution they had decided on was streamlining and migrating to Drupal 8.

They had narrowed it down to Acquia Cloud. The next step was to migrate their highly custom platform onto Drupal and Acquia.

While they had an experienced inhouse team to carry out the migration, this team was completely new to Drupal

## Solution

The new website had a decoupled setup. The frontend was powered by ReactJS, and Drupal was used to deliver the data using GraphQL

## Results

Part of the new system was launched successfully. At the close of the engagement, the customer's team had completed a small migration from their WordPress based portal to the Drupal site as part of their consolidation efforts. Following this, they were in the process of migrating the data.

With this engagement, our team was able to support the customer through a massive technology shift. Axelerant's managed staffing offering helped them manage changing staffing requirements, brought on by changes to their tech stack. Ultimately, we helped them onboard effectively to a new, more suitable technology, expediting their migration to Drupal on Acquia Cloud.New York (SUNY) Maritime College](https://www.axelerant.com/success-stories/suny-maritime-college-drupal-migration), and [A Prominent Research University in the United States](https://www.axelerant.com/success-stories/quality-assurance/higher-education/drupal-qa), apart from the [University of East London](https://www.axelerant.com/success-stories/dxp-for-university-of-east-london).
