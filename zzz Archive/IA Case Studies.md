Case study - 1 Enterprise-level Retail Megalith: Consolidating DX across 90+ Diverse Brands
===========================================================================================

Services Delivered Site Build & Feature Enhancements

The customer is an enterprise-level retail megalith composed of some of the world's most recognized brands and household names. The franchise currently operates across the whole of Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey with more than 4000 stores, 90 plus consumer retail brands, and 35 years of operations history.\
Our partner Acquia was the primary solution provider and augmented our teams over a multi-year of development and delivery roadmap for the client.

## Business Challenge
Of the nearly 90 brands in the customer's portfolio, some were on Drupal, while others used a mix of open-source and proprietary CMSs. Not all had a web presence. In a lot of Middle Eastern markets, there are no online stores. Most brands here had physical stores. Others had a web presence, but no eCommerce capabilities.

Given all this, there was a lack of standardization across the brands, both in terms of the customers' as well as the editors' experience. It also meant that the client was spending a lot on maintaining and updating these sites while losing precious time in launching new brands online. They needed to consolidate digital experience across their diverse brands.

## Solution

Axelerant came together with Acquia to deliver a front-end solution that would allow clients to launch websites quickly without involving developers.

Acquia Cloud and Acquia Cloud Site Factory (ACSF) hid the provisioning of servers behind a layer so that users don't need to see the complexity involved. Their user-friendly interface allows sites to be deployed easily and effectively without involving developers. This makes the product a great fit for business owners launching in new regions and demographics.

We also helped the Acquia team with fixing bugs and modifying their Drupal-Magento Ecommerce connector module which would bring content from Drupal, Product Management, and retail systems together onto a single interface.

Other key features delivered as part of this solution included an improved Config Management, consistent and effective custom theme management, mobile application API development, Instant Search functionality, A Single Page Checkout, and more.

## Results

All brand sites for the Retail Megalith client were brought onto one platform. The process of maintenance was simplified and the Total Cost of Ownership was significantly reduced.
